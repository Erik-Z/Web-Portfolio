                            Hi, my name is Erik, I graduated with a Computer Science undergraduate degree from Stony Brook University. I have most experience with web development, but can also program mobile applications and do game development. The languages I am most proficient in are JavaScript, Python, and Java. I am an active learner so picking up new languages and technologies is not a problem for me. I have done enough projects to be able to approach a wide range of problems in a pragmatic and efficient way.
